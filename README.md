# Poopy Chat

A crude chat app made using Express and Socket.io.

## Try it yourself

I don't have a server to host this on, so you need to run this locally.

Clone the project

```sh
git clone https://github.com/MarsRon/poopy-chat
```

Go to the project directory

```sh
cd poopy-chat/server
```

Install dependencies

```sh
npm install
```

Start the server

```sh
npm start
```

Open `localhost:3000` after running these commands.
